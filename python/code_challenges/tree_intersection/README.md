# Code Challenge
- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
- Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficeincy
- Add in nodes from the first tree and the second to a hashmap. Run the contatins function on the hashmap to see if there are any common values.
